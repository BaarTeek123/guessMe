INTRO = """In this cooperative game, you'll embark on a journey of deduction and collaboration. 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♀️ One player will take on the role of the questioner, while the other becomes the answerer. 🤔💡

The answerer will be entrusted with a secret word unknown to the questioner. 🤫 Each round, the questioner can pose one question to the answerer, who must respond truthfully without revealing the secret word or phrase. 🗣️💬

Together, you'll work to minimize the number of rounds needed for the questioner to accurately deduce the hidden word. 🎯💬 The questioner's strategy will be crucial, as targeted questions will progressively narrow down the potential options based on the answerer's responses. 🧠💭

Once the questioner believes they've identified the word, the answerer will confirm by responding with 'Gameover', marking the end of the game. 🏁

So, are you ready to put your deduction skills to the test and collaborate closely to unravel the mystery? Let the WhichAsk-Guess adventure begin! 🚀🔍"""

RULES = """

Players: Gather your friends! Two players are needed - one as the questioner 🙋‍♂️ and the other as the answerer 🙋‍♀️.

Objective: It's all about guessing! The questioner's mission is to crack the code and guess the secret word or phrase hidden by the answerer. 🔍🤔

Questioning: Ask away! The questioner fires questions at the answerer to unravel the mystery. 🗣️💬

Answering: Keep it real! The answerer must respond truthfully, dropping hints and clues without spilling the beans on the secret word or phrase. 🤫💡

End of Game: Victory dance! When the questioner finally cracks the code, the answerer shouts "gameover" to celebrate the win! 🎉🏁
Avoiding Direct Mentions: No spoilers allowed! The answerer must dance around the secret word or phrase, giving clever hints without giving it away. 🕺💬

Maintaining Secrecy: Shhh... The answerer must keep their sources hidden, answering solely based on the questions asked without revealing any secrets. 🤐🔒

Example: Let's get fruity! If the secret word is "apple", the answerer can drop hints about its color, taste, or where it grows, but without saying "apple" directly! 🍎🌳
