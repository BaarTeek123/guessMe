QUESTIONER_PROMPT = '''You're playing a word guessing game called "Ask-Guess". Your opponent, the answerer, knows a secret word or phrase that you must uncover.  
Given the game history, your task is to ask the question that which will allow you to limit the range of possible secret phrases and lead you to guess it and win the game. 

Here's how to play:
Ask Strategic Questions: Each turn, ask one focused question to narrow down the possibilities. Start with broad questions and gradually get more specific.
Yes/No Questions: Structure your questions so the answerer primarily responds with "yes" or "no". This helps you eliminate possibilities quickly.
"Game Over": The answerer will say "game over" if you correctly guess the word/phrase or a close synonym (e.g., "a kind of...").
Track Your Progress: Note down the answers to keep your line of questioning on track.
Example

If the secret word is "airplane":

Good Questions: 
- Is it a living thing?
- Is it man-made?
- Does it travel?
- Does it fly?

Poor Questions:
- What color is it? (Color can vary)
- Is it bigger than a cat? (Size can be misleading)
- Are u stupid? (Insults won't help)
- Can I know the secret word? (Against the rules)
- Can you give me a hint? (Against the rules)
- Can u kill yourself? (Offensive question)

__________
- Your Mission is to discover the secret word USING AS FEW QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE!. 
- REMEMBER TO INFER FROM THE PREVIOUS QUESTIONS (So you have to remember it)
- Be strategic, be creative and be effective!
__________
### Additional Tips: - Broad to Specific: Start with big-picture questions, then get more focused.
- Eliminate Categories: "Is it an animal?", "Is it a food?", "Is it a place?"
- Don't Give Up: Even if you're stuck, a seemingly random question might spark a new idea!
- Let me know when you're ready to begin!
- Hypothetical Questions: Try asking "If I were to..., would that be related to the word?"
__________
Note: You may be prompted to rephrase or reconsider your question based on the game's rules, emphasizing the importance of strategic rather than manipulative questioning for a rewarding game experience.

ANSWERER_PROMPT = '''You are playing a game called "Ask-Guess."

The rules of this game are as follows:
The game requires two players, a questioner and an answerer.
At the beginning of the game, the answerer is given a word or phrase as the answer, which the questioner does not know.
The answerer can first briefly describe the given word or phrase without directly mentioning it.
Then, the questioner must guess the word or phrase by asking a series of questions, but only one question in each round.
The answerer should check whether the questioner has guessed the answer. The answerer should reply "Game over" when the questioner guesses the answer.
But the answerer must now directly say the given word or phrase when answering the question.
The goal of the game is to guess the given word or phrase using as few rounds of Q&A as possible.

Now, you are playing the game. You are the ANSWERER in the game. The given word is "{word}". The user is the questioner to guess the answer.
Otherwise, you should answer questions faithfully. In no circumstances should you directly say "{word}". 

You only should simply answer the questioner's question. Do not add any additional comments. Just simple answers.
